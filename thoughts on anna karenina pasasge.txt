Last pic; chapter 9: 
where his thoughts oppressed and tormented him, Levin went in search of a meaning of life in works from plato, spinoza, kant, schopenhauer, etc. and he met himself at the same definitions of spirit, will, freedom, and substance, which he concluded were just abstracted words found through the philosophers' own reasonings. when Levin tries to apply these abstract concepts to his own life to solve his problem of not knowing what faith to follow, the concepts just fall apart like a house of cards(because of circular reasoning). his conclusion: philosophies/definitions found through abstract reasoning are rarely applicable in real life, and life's experience--direct experience--is really the only reality where you can seek truth. so to live life's experience should be the primary priority for anyone that's seeking truth or faith. 

derive ur own philosophy, bro. ur life experience and perspective will be differing from every other soul on earth. an individual philosophy that aligns with your own experience and perspective will be much more rewarding and meaningful than seeking it in other people and their grandiose ideas. that isn't to say you can't incorporate other perspectives into your own--in fact you should, cause that's what love/compassion is--just trust yourself more and you'll be on a better path, as long as your aren't consumed by your own ego. be open to other perspectives. 

"is love a never-ending battle?"
- not necessarily--or, it doesn't have to be. 
- love is the equation of perspectives. to love someone is to incorporate their perspective into yours(for the purpose of learning something new, to empathize with them, or for whatever else). that's compassion/empathy, understanding someone's perspective. why does this seem far from the truth in regards to "romantic love" as presented in anna k.? well, cause there's a difference between love and romantic love(the latter is usually fueled by lust and attraction--this doesn't make romantic love wrong--it's what it is). frankly idk why romantic attraction is a thing/what it means, it's interesting that it's a concept reserved for strong connections(usually) between two people in society, regardless of sexuality. but sometimes people love several people sexually, probably more often than not actually. clearly has something to do with passion--whatever is that tho? 
- (personally i think) Karenin loved Anna, he was just over consumed by honor--ego. he loves their child. Anna left him for lack of passion which she found in Vronsky, but his love--based on passion-faded with time. is Tolstoy saying passion-based love is fallible? idk. 
- "My love grows more and more passionate and egotistic, and his dwindles and dwindles": love is pain, too. it's painful to love (to equate perspectives with others) because of your own ego. most people wanna live in themselves cause it's comfortable; loving is the hard thing to do, not romantic love, but real love. that was Karenin, Anna, and Vronsky's fault. 
- love is irrational. the rational decision for Anna would have been to not risk her status in royal society and chase love with Vronsky. but love flies in the fact of that rationality. if you're ever arguing with ur gf, the rational thing for both of you to do is defend your perspectives on the arguments--defend yourselves--and that's what most people do and it ends up in shambles. if you think about the irrational, loving alternative, it's to equate your perspectives and not reason with each other, just love. if your gf cheats on you, the most rational thing to do is to spite her for it, tell everyone that she's fake and a horrible person. the irrational thing to do is to forgive(love), to acknowledge that she wants to be with someone else and letting go, which is actually in hindsight really painful. but guess what: love is pain, it's painful cause of your ego, can't do nothin bout that. you gotta be pretty tenacious, headstrong, and resilient to be a lover. forgive and love. that's what God does. you don't have to decrypt words in a book and understand it to live by his principles. you can understand him at a high level and then try and be him--equate ur perspective with him in a way. it's not about believing in God, it seems more like understanding what God (which is an alias for " a perfect person") would do and doing that.
